Today we're going to talk about something that causes most physics students to lose interest in solid state
physics^[Can't entirely say I blame them.]: Crystal symmetries and (some) of their uses. As painful as it is,
these things are really useful and they pop up all over the place. I try to painlessly intersperse them into
more entertaining stuff as much as possible, but sometimes there's no avoiding spending a whole
chapther/blog post on just crystallopgraphy. And this is one those situations...

As usual, we start with packages:

```{julia}
using Pkg
Pkg.activate("./env")

using SimpleQuantum
using MinkowskiReduction
using Brillouin
using StaticArrays
using SplitApplyCombine
using Combinatorics
using LinearAlgebra

using Colors
using GLMakie
theme = Theme(
    Lines = (color = :orangered2, cycle = [],)
)
set_theme!(theme)
```

## Using our package
This is going to be the first time we're using the library (package in Julia terms) that we started working on
[previously](/posts/cmpm3/). I named it somewhat unimaginably `SimpleQuantum` and, if you look at it's
[repo](https://github.com/tpolakovic/SimpleQuantum), it's already at version 0.2.5 (I'm using
[Semantic versioning](https://semver.org)).

It's not on the Julia package registry, so to add it, you have to provide the link to the repo. From now on, I'll 
try my best to always keep these posts synced with releases of the package, but not this time. The package went 
through a lot in the last couple of months, so what we'll be doing today is already in there. If you want it in a 
state closest to what's happening in this post, you should add it at version 0.2.5 by writing the putting the 
following into your Julia REPL:

````
] add https://github.com/tpolakovic/SimpleQuantum#v0.2.5
````
:::

There a few usual suspects that don't need any introduction and `Combinatorics` is pretty self-explanatory. Then 
there's a bunch of new stuff: `MinkowskiReduction` is a package for basis reduction (explanation later), 
`Brillouin` is used for some nice visualization of Brillouin zones and Wigner-Seitz cells, `StaticArrays` is for 
more efficient small arrays, and `SplitApplyCombine` for some convenience functions related to array splitting and 
combining.

### Dense motivation {#sec-cmpm4-dos}

To motivate why we should bother with all this, let's propose the following problem: Imagine that we have function
$f(\vec{k})$ which is a function of momentum in our crystal. And now imagine that we want an integral of the 
function, in principle over the whole (momentum) space:

$$
F = \int f(\vec{k}) d\vec{k}
$$

Easy enough, if it weren't for the fact that we'll want to do this numerically and the momentum space is infinite.
While we're imagining, let's also imagine that we have a large (but for the moment finite) $D$-dimensional crystal with $\mathcal{N} = \prod_{i=1} ^{D} \mathcal{N}_i$ unit cells. If the crystal is finite, it has finite amount of lattice vectors and, consequently, also only a finite amount of physically meaningful reciprocal lattice
points^[See the [previous discussion](/posts/cmpm3/#sec-cmpm3-groups) on real and reciprocal spaces in crystals]:

$$
\vec{q}_{\vec{l}} = \sum_i ^D \frac{l_i}{\mathcal{N}_i} \vec{G}_{n_i}.
$$

For a sufficiently large crystal, a sum over the vectors $\vec{q}_{\vec{l}}$ can be thought of as the Riemann sum,
meaning that we can write:
$$
\frac{(2\pi)^3}{\mathcal{V}}\sum_{\vec{q}_{\vec{l}}} f(\vec{q}_{\vec{l}})= \frac{(2\pi)^3}{\mathcal{N}\Omega}\sum _{\vec{q} ^{\prime} _{\vec{l}}} f(\vec{q} ^{\prime} _{\vec{l}}) \stackrel{\mathcal{N} \rightarrow \infty}{=} \int f(\vec{q}) d\vec{q},
$$

Where $\Omega$ is the volume of the unit cell. In the second expression, I used the fact that all momenta in a
crystal can be represented only by the momenta $\vec{q}^{\prime}$ in the first Brillouin zone.^[Again, see the [previous discussion](/posts/cmpm3/#sec-cmpm3-groups) -- told you it's gonna be important.]

That's the formal side, now let's imagine an actual physics problem: heat capacity of metals at low temperatures.
From thermodynamics, we know that the specific heat of...well, anything really, is defined as:

$$
c_V = \frac{1}{\mathcal{V}} \left. \frac{\partial E}{\partial T} \right|_{\mathcal{V}},
$$

which describes how much does the internal energy of the system change when we change it's temperature while 
keeping volume
constant.^[If this is new to you, googling some [lecture notes](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/schwartz/files/5-thermodynamics.pdf) or procuring a [book](https://books.google.com/books/about/Fundamentals_of_Statistical_and_Thermal.html?id=ObsbAAAAQBAJ) is probably a good idea.] To get the total energy of our electrons, we need to count
how many there are at each energy and multiply them by that value. Because we're talking thermodynamics, we need
to introduce probability distributions into the mix, to properly count how many electrons there are at a given
(degenerate) energy level at a given temperature $T$. Because electrons are fermions, that probability
distribution is the Fermi-Dirac distribution
$f(\epsilon, T) = \frac{1}{\exp{\left( \frac{\epsilon - E_{F}}{T} \right)} + 1}$,
where $E_F$ is the [Fermi energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_energy) (maximum occupied energy of the 
system). With that, the energy of the electron system is:

$$
E(T) = 2 \mathcal{V} \int N(\epsilon) \epsilon f(\epsilon, T) d\epsilon,
$$

Where $N(\epsilon)$ is the number of electron states at energy $\epsilon$ (factor of 2 because each state can take 
two electrons of opposite spin). After using the
[Sommerfeld expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sommerfeld_expansion) for the expression 
above, we get (up to second order in temperature):

$$
E(T) = E_0 + \frac{\pi^2}{3} T^2 N(E_F) \mathcal{V}.
$$

From there, it's pretty straight forward to show that the specific heat simply becomes:

$$
c_V = \frac{2\pi^2}{3} N(E_F) T.
$$

You could argue that the intergral above is across energies and not momentum, but remember that the eigenstates 
and eigenenergies of our crystal Hamiltonian [functions of momentum](/posts/cmpm3/#its-waves-all-the-way-down),
so it can be rewritten in the form:

$$
E(T) = 2 \mathcal{V} \int N(\epsilon(\vec{k})) \epsilon(\vec{k}) f(\epsilon(\vec{k}), T) d\vec{k} = 
\int d\epsilon \int \delta( \epsilon - E(\vec{k})) E(\vec{k}) f(E(\vec{k}), T) d\vec{k},
$$

Which, as complicated as it looks, is our self-imposed problem. The function that counts the states at a given 
energy:

$$
N(E) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^D}\int \delta(E - E(\vec{k})) d\vec{k} \approx \frac{1}{\mathcal{V}} \sum _{\vec{k}_i} \delta(E - E(\vec{k}_i))
$$

is called the [density of states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_of_states) and it pops up all over the 
place in solid state and condensed matter, so even if it were the only thing we'll be able to calculate after we 
finish this part, it is worthwhile to do.

### Living on the grid {#sec-cmpm4-mpgrid}

Just looking at the equations above, you'd think that the integrating over the Brillouin zone is not that hard.
We already have two ways of calculating the energy (or whatever other property) as function of
momentum^[Three, if we count the empty lattice approximation.], so we can just spread a dense enough grid over the 
momentum space, evaluate the function(s) and sum it all together. You'd be right. But it's often desirable to do 
this integration many times^[Tens of thousands of times in some cases.] and, in that case, we should be efficient 
at it.

The way the integrals are evaluated in practice has been proposed by Monkhorst and Pack @monkhorst1976special,
after which it's called the Monkhorst-Pack grid method (MP grid for short). Their idea is that many points in the
momentum space can be transformed into each other by the symmetries of the lattice, so the functions on these 
points will have identical values. After this realization, the task becomes to find the smallest possible number
of k-vectors that *cannot* be transformed into each other and finding how many "relatives" these points have 
(i.e., into how many grid points in the Brillouin zone can they be transformed by lattice symmetries).

The first thing to do is generating a grid that coincides with the symmetries of the reciprocal lattice. Let's have
a D-dimensional crystal with primitive reciprocal lattice vectors $\left\{ \vec{G}_{n} \right\}_{n = 1} ^{D}$. 
Next let's define a grid spacing in reduced coordinates as:

$$
\left\{ u_r \right\}_{r = 1} ^q = \left\{  \frac{2r - q - 1}{2q} \right\}_{r = 1} ^q.
$$

The grid with correct symmetries will then consist of points in k-space:

$$
\vec{k}_{\vec{r}} = \sum_{i = 1} ^D u_{r_i} \vec{G}_i,
$$

or, in other words, the correct grid is a square/cube grid in reduced coordinates with $q$ points along each axis.
Coding this part is trivial:

```{julia}
function mpspace(q::Integer)
    ((2r - q - 1) / 2q for r ∈ 1:q)
end;
```

As we will be plotting a bunch in the Brillouin zone, I'll quickly make a function that plots it, using the 
`wignerseitz` method from `Brillouin`:

```{julia}
function plotbz(c::Crystal)
    gs = c.lattice.G' |> eachcol |> collect
    c = wignerseitz(gs)
    plot(c)
end;
```

::: {.callout-note collapse=true}
## `eachcol |> collect`ing

`wignerseitz` takes the reciprocal basis as a vector or vectors, so I use `eachcol` to split my $G$ matrix into
columns and `collect` it into a vector.
:::

And I'll define a simple square lattice which we'll use for visualization and demonstration purposes:

```{julia}
cr = Crystal(
    Lattice(1, 1, 90,),
    UnitCell([0., 0.,])
)
```

The Brillouin zone of a square lattice is a square, which we can now finally plot along with our MP grid:

```{julia}
plotbz(cr)

ks = Iterators.product(ntuple(_ -> mpspace(4), ndims(cr))...)
G = cr.lattice.G'

for k ∈ ks
    k = collect(k)
    k = G * k
    scatter!(k...; color=:orange)
end

current_figure()
```

Nothing too exciting. I just create a 1D MP grid with 4 gridpoints and use `Iterators.product` to make all 
products of them, forming a 2D square grid (and multiply by $G$ to get k-vectors in direct coords). This being a 
square crystal, it will have a bunch of symmetries, like the 4-fold rotational symmetry, which means that, e.g., 
all the points in the corners are equivalent. So the next step will be to progamatically find all the symmetries 
of a crystal.

### Grouping points {#sec-cmpm4-pg}

And this is where things become more interesting.
